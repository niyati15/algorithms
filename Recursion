What id recursion?

calls itself in itself
all recursive functions have 2 cases:
1.  a base case which with stop recursion
2.  a recursive case where the function calls itself

e.g. factorial of a number
function factorial(num){
    //BASE CASE
    if(num === 1){
        return num;
    }
    else{
        return num * factorial(num - 1);
    }
}
