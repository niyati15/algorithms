What is a call stack?

It shows what order our function is being called in and what variables are being call with



e.g. factorial of a number
function factorial(num){
    //BASE CASE
    if(num === 1){
        return num;
    }
    else{
        return num * factorial(num - 1);
    }
}


factorial(4)    num = 4     ret 4 * factorial(3)
factorial(3)    num = 3     ret 3 * factorial(2)
factorial(2)    num = 2     ret 2 * factorial(1)
factorial(1)                ret 1
